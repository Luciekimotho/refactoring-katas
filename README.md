# Writing Clean Code pracitcal sessions: Refactoring Katas
This repository contains some starting files for Microsoft FTEs to practice their refactoring skills on. These katas are originally coming from the great [Refactoring-Katas repository on GitHub](https://github.com/marcoemrich/Refactoring-Katas). Two katas are avaialble today:
- [Gilded Rose Kata](./GildedRose) in C#
- [Yahtzee Kata](./Yahtzee) in C#

**NB!** If you are about to play the [game of mob refactoring](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint-df.com/:b:/p/dabelyak/EW5rmuZG18hOmY1CttxyhrcB2ybFStoCVxhVv7lNfNjPFQ?e=J3P4jZ) and came here to practice before the game... It is up to you of course, but do remember that you can only experience that first run on a kata material once. Any other would not be the first :)
